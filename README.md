## Overview
As the name suggests it is a to do list application which is used to keep track of your tasks in either completed state or incomplete state.
It is a light theme based application suitable for viewing on both desktop and mobile devices.
It was tested to run on Mozilla Firefox, Safari and Chrome for upto 4 previous versions including the current versions.
It is made using HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript and the tasks aren't persistent meaning that they are removed when the tab is closed or refreshed.

## Features
* Adding a task
  * Can be done by typing in the input box and pressing enter or clicking the add button
* Removing a task
  * The delete button appears after hovering over the task and in mobile screen the task needs to be tapped in order for it to show.
* Toggling the state of task
  * The checkbox can be used to mark the task as either complete or incomplete. Check mark means complete and no mark means incomplete.
* Complete all tasks

  * It'll removed the tasks present on screen that have been marked as complete.
* The three tabs All, Incomplete, Completed
  * The corresponding type of tasks are shown based on the selected tab.
  * All shows both complete and incomplete tasks
